            <p class = "dcf-m-5"> I understand that the production or customization of weapons, weapon accessories, weapon parts, ammunition, or tools of vandalism is strictly prohibited. 
            I understand that any attempts to produce these items will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.</p>
            <p class = "dcf-m-5">I agree that while the College of Engineering Design Hub provides a shared workspace, 
                    I am responsible for cleaning up after myself. 
                    I understand that cleaning supplies are available and can be requested if needed.</p>
            <p class = "dcf-m-5">I agree that access to the College of Engineering Design Hub is a privilege and not a right. 
                    I acknowledge that all policies are posted on the website, and it is my responsibility to learn and follow them. 
                    I understand that violating policies, whether knowingly or unknowingly, will result in consequences based on the severity of the violation, 
                    as determined by staff.</p>
            <p class = "dcf-m-5">I agree to ask questions when I’m not sure how to do something. 
                    I realize that many accidents happen because people are too proud to ask questions about proper fixturing and job setup, 
                    and I will help ensure safety by asking questions and seeking advice from staff and experienced users.</p>
            <p class = "dcf-m-5">I agree to clean up as I go before I leave the shop. 
                I realize that “out of sight is out of mind”, and that if I leave the shop I am likely to get distracted and forget to clean up. 
                I will help ensure safety by sweeping and vacuuming, and putting away tools I have taken out.</p>
            <p class = "dcf-m-5">I agree to wear proper protective gear at all times. 
                I realize that “I’m just grabbing a screwdriver” is not an excuse to go into the machine shop without safety glasses, closed toed shoes, hair tied up, and so on. 
                I understand that I may be asked to leave for the day, or my machine shop privileges may be permanently revoked, 
                if I fail to wear proper protective gear at all times.</p>
            <p class = "dcf-m-5">I agree I will not use any machines on which 
                I haven’t been certified to use. I understand the machines may seem simple and safe or 
                I may have relevant prior experience, but that proper certification is incredibly important. 
                I realize that by going through the established certification process, 
                I will learn how to operate the machines and contribute to my safety and the safety of the facility.</p>
            <p class = "dcf-m-5">I agree to report any unsafe conditions I see to staff. 
                I realize that many accidents could be avoided if someone spoke up about potentially unsafe actions. 
                I will speak up, even if I am not sure if the situation is safe or unsafe, and even if more experienced users are involved.</p>
            <p class = "dcf-m-5">I understand that this User Agreement lasts ONE YEAR and will need to be renewed annually in order to continue to use the Engineering Design Hub.</p>
